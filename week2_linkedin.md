Week 2 of my 8-week Go challenge (Dec 14-20, 2025).

WHAT I BUILT

This week I explored intermediate Go concepts:
• Maps and key-value operations
• Functions - pass by value vs reference behavior
• All loop patterns and range variations
• Structs with methods (value vs pointer receivers)
• Interfaces and polymorphism
• 12 Go files total covering maps to OOP concepts

Best work: Interface implementation with perfect polymorphism understanding. Discovered how Go's interfaces enable clean, polymorphic code.

KEY DISCOVERIES

Found important patterns through experimentation:
• Comma-ok pattern for map operations (value, ok := map[key])
• How Go automatically converts between value and pointer receivers
• Interface implementation and polymorphism mechanics
• Difference between pass-by-value for arrays vs slices

All discovered by writing code, breaking it, fixing it, and reading Go's standard library source.

SELF-REVIEW RESULTS

AI code reviews (Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5):

Week 2 Rating: 8.0/10 (B+)
Improvement from Week 1: +1.0 point

Strengths: Excellent hands-on discovery, strong grasp of OOP concepts, clean polymorphic code, comprehensive loop exploration

Gaps: Still missing error handling, public/private scope confusion (package-level vs file-level), no input validation, security issues in example code

The structured feedback continues to be valuable for identifying exactly what needs improvement.

PROGRESS TRACKING
