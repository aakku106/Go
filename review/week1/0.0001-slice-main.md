# Code Review: 0.0001/slice/main.go

## Overall Assessment

**File Purpose**: Dedicated slice demonstration  
**Status**: Similar to parent main.go but more focused  
**Rating**: 6/10

---

## Detailed Review

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Focused Content**: This file focuses specifically on slices, which is better organization
2. **Same Excellent Explanations**: You've kept the detailed slice explanations
3. **Good Separation**: Moving slice examples to a separate file shows good instinct for code organization

### ⚠️ Issues

#### 1. **Code Duplication**

This file appears to be nearly identical to the slice portions of `0.0001/main.go`. This is code duplication and should be avoided.

**Better Approach**:

- Keep slice examples in ONE place
- Import and reuse functions if needed
- Or, make this the authoritative slice example and remove from main.go

#### 2. **Same Issues as Parent File**

All issues from `0.0001/main.go` apply here:

- Variable naming (`string` variable name)
- Spelling errors
- Comment formatting
- Missing `printSlice()` and `stringPrint()` definitions in this file

#### 3. **Package Organization**

Both files are in `package main`, which means:

- Only one can have a `main()` function per directory
- You need to run: `go run main.go proveSlice.go`
- This is confusing for beginners

**Better Structure**:

```
0.0001/
├── main.go              // Calls slice examples
├── slice/
│   └── examples.go      // package slice (not main)
```

Then in examples.go:

```go
package slice

import "fmt"

// DemonstrateBasics shows basic slice operations
func DemonstrateBasics() {
    // your code here
}
```

And in main.go:

```go
package main

import "yourmodule/slice"

func main() {
    slice.DemonstrateBasics()
}
```

**Good practice**: Verifying your understanding with tools/resources  
**Better practice**: Also test your code thoroughly yourself

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Duplication**: Keep slice examples in ONE location only
2. **Create Proper Package Structure**: Learn about Go modules and packages
3. **Write Tests**: Create `slice_test.go` to test your understanding:

   ```go
   func TestSliceCapacity(t *testing.T) {
       s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
       sub := s[2:]
       if cap(sub) != 3 {
           t.Errorf("Expected capacity 3, got %d", cap(sub))
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Add a README**: Document what each file does and how to run them
