Started an 8-week(2 month) Go challenge. Here's Week 1 (Dec 7-13, 2025).

WHAT I BUILT

This week I implemented data structures from scratch:
• Slice manipulation - explored how Go slices work internally (capacity, length, memory behavior)
• Stack implementation - LIFO with push/pop operations
• Queue variations - linear queue, circular queue, and priority queue
• 11 Go files total covering basics to intermediate concepts

Best work: circular queue implementation. Got the modulo arithmetic right and created a clean, working solution.

HOW I LEARNED

Pure trial and error approach:
• Wrote code, broke things, fixed them
• Read Go's built-in source code and standard library to understand how things work
• Implemented data structures to learn about memory and pointers
• Documented findings in code comments

No tutorials. No courses. Just experimentation and reading the language itself.

SELF-REVIEW PROCESS

After finishing the week, I had AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5 mainly, some GPT-5) conduct detailed code reviews of all my work.

Week 1 Rating: 7.0/10 (B+)

Strengths: Good algorithmic thinking, deep exploration of concepts, correct implementations

Gaps: No unit tests, spelling errors in code, need better error handling, should follow Go conventions more closely

Having structured AI feedback is valuable for tracking progress and knowing exactly what to improve.

WHAT'S NEXT

Week 2: Structs, methods, and interfaces
Week 3: Concurrency, HTTP, and error handling
...continuing for 8 weeks total

Posting updates every Saturday. Goal isn't perfection - it's consistent learning and measurable improvement.

CODE & REVIEWS

Everything is on GitHub:
Repository: https://github.com/aakku106/Go
Week 1 Code: /0.0001/, /0.0002/, /0.0004/
AI Reviews: /review/week1/

Each file has a comprehensive review covering what works, what doesn't, and specific improvements needed.
