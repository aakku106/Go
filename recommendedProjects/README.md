   - Can you test just this part?

3. **Search for examples**

   - GitHub: search for similar projects
   - Go packages: pkg.go.dev
   - Tutorials and blogs

4. **Ask the community**

   - Reddit: r/golang
   - Discord/Slack Go channels
   - Stack Overflow
   - Go Forum

5. **Take a break**
   - Sometimes you need distance
   - Sleep on it
   - Come back fresh
